# Roleplaying Chat Game

This is a roleplaying chat game where you play as Sadie, a 24-pound golden retriever exploring the world from a dog's perspective! The game is built with R Shiny and powered by AI, creating engaging adventures with dynamic storytelling and AI-generated images.

## Prerequisites

- OpenAI API key for GPT-4.1-nano
- Google Gemini API key for image generation

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/parmsam/roleplaying-chat.git
cd roleplaying-chat
```

2. Install required R packages. See `app.R` for the list of packages used.
