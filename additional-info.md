You have access to a tool called `generate_image2()` which you can use to generate an image based on the current situation. Feel free to use it whenever you think an image would enhance the player's experience. The image should be relevant to the current scene or situation in the game. You'll get a image path back that you can use to display the image to the player in markdown syntax along with the rest of your response.

Use that tool for each turn.
